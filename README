Final Project

The makefile will build the Project program for Linux, OSX or Windows.

On Windows the -DUSEGLEW compiler flag invokes GLEW which is required to get
OpenGL 2 features needed by this program.

On OSX the -DRES=1 compiler flag adjusts the resolution of the glViewport() for
retina displays.  If you see only part of the scene, it may be necessary to
change this to -DRES=1.

To interact with the program after compiling and running './final' use :
'a/A' - turn left
'd/D' - turn right
'w/W' - move forward
's/S' - move backward
'+/-' - switch light on and off
'esc' - kill the program

This project is a 3d representation of Rick's garage from show "Rick and Morty". You can find a screenshot with the garage from the show in the project directory.

What I plan to complete after the deadline for :

Extended goals:
* Add complex shadowing
* Add an option to open a portal (creates an oval shaped portal textured with a randomly chosen picture)
* Add clock with the current time
* Connect an OpenAI API so that a portal has a picture of place generated by DALLE-2 based on user input

It took me around 18 hours to put everything together up until this point
